# Masters_Research_WangLab
This is a summary of the projects I did for my Masters research in the Daifeng Wang lab at UW-Madison (2023-2024). I used machine learning in Python to classify patients as Alzheimer's positive or negative based on their genomic data. I also created an R Shiny app to visualize gene and cell interactions in Alzheimer's Disease.
