# Masters_Research_WangLab
This is a summary of the projects I did for my Masters research in the Daifeng Wang lab at UW-Madison (2023-2024). I used machine learning in Python to classify patients as Alzheimer's positive or negative based on their genomic data. I also created an R Shiny app to visualize gene and cell interactions in Alzheimer's Disease.

Description of machine learning project:
- Advanced Benchmark Algos 1-6.ipynb shows my optimization of k-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Neural Network (Multilayer Perceptron).
- Advanced Benchmark Algo 7.ipynb shows my optimization of Random Forest.
- I also benchmarked DeepGAMI (https://github.com/daifengwanglab/DeepGAMI/) and MOGONet (https://github.com/txWang/MOGONET) classifiers, but they are not shown here. This makes a total of 9 machine learning algorithms.
- Advanced Benchmark Barplots.ipynb summarizes the results of my benchmarking.

Description of R Shiny project:
- app.R is the app I created to visualize gene and cell interactions in Alzheimer's Disease.
- Supplemental data is not included as it is not owned by me.
